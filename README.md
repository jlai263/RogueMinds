```sh
java -jar MathQuest.jar [options]
```

Replace `[options]` with any necessary command-line options or arguments.

#### Running in an IDE
If you prefer to run the application from an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can import the project into your IDE and run the `Main` class directly.

### Building from Source

#### Using Apache Maven
If you have Apache Maven installed, you can build the application from source using the following command:

```sh
mvn clean package
```

This command will compile the source code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file named `MathQuest.jar` located in the `target` directory.

#### Without Apache Maven
If you do not have Apache Maven installed, you can compile the source code manually using the following command:

```sh
javac -d bin src/main/java/com/example/Main.java
```

This command will compile the `Main.java` file and place the compiled class files in the `bin` directory.

To package the application into a JAR file, navigate to the `bin` directory and use the following command:

```sh
jar cvf MathQuest.jar com/example/*.class
```
